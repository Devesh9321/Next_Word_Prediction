Next Word Prediction 
===================

<p align="justify">
A next-word prediction model is a powerful application of natural language processing that can be built using Python. This model aims to anticipate the following word in a sentence, improving text generation and aiding in various language-related tasks. To create a simple next-word prediction model, one can utilize news articles as training data. By preprocessing and tokenizing the text, you can prepare the data for training. Techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models can be employed to effectively capture the contextual relationships between words. Through iterative training, the model learns the probabilities of words appearing after certain sequences, thereby enhancing its predictive capabilities. Implementing this in Python provides a practical way to delve into language modeling and its real-world applications.

### Setup 

I've articulated the steps in text format here : 

- Install the dependencies following these steps : 

  - Star this repository (top right corner) 
  - <>Code > Download ZIP > Open cmd/terminal in that location
  - Create Virtual Environment : `virtualenv env`
  - Start Virtual Environment : `./env/Scripts/activate.ps1`
  - Reqiuired packages : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Run this command : `python main.py`

\* The setup for different projects might not be the same. Please refer to the individual setup guides given for each project.
